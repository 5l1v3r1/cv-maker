# cv-maker

this app makes a markdown only resume from details you provide

try it out here: http://awal.js.org/cv-maker/

the markdown is standard markdown, compatible with github flavored markdown, php extended markdown, gitlab flavored markdown, and most other flavors as well.

it can be converted to plain html, which renders perfectly in every browser old and new alike, is responsive by default and works on all mobile platforms, doesn't require JS or even CSS support to view.

it looks simple, minimalistic, readable, and perfectly decent to everyone except hipsters like apple fanboys. it is also easy to edit manually, since it is all just markdown really

# TODO
- documentation (srs bsns)
- add joke for Microsoft and Google fanboys as well
